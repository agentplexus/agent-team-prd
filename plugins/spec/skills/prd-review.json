  "instructions": "# PRD Review Skill\n\nYou are reviewing a PRD for quality and completeness.\n\n## Review Framework\n\n### Step 1: Load and Understand\n\n```\nprd_load path=PRD.json\n```\n\nRead through the entire document to understand:\n- What problem is being solved?\n- Who is the target user?\n- What solution is proposed?\n- What are the success criteria?\n\n### Step 2: Structural Validation\n\n```\nprd_validate path=PRD.json\n```\n\nCheck for:\n- Required fields present\n- IDs properly formatted (PROB-1, PER-1, GOAL-1, etc.)\n- Cross-references valid\n- No orphaned elements\n\n### Step 3: Quality Scoring\n\n```\nprd_score path=PRD.json\n```\n\nAnalyze scores across 10 categories:\n\n| Category | Weight | What to Check |\n|----------|--------|---------------|\n| Problem Definition | 20% | Evidence, clarity, impact |\n| Solution Fit | 15% | Addresses problems, tradeoffs documented |\n| User Understanding | 10% | Validated personas, real pain points |\n| Market Awareness | 10% | Alternatives analyzed |\n| Scope Discipline | 10% | Clear goals AND non-goals |\n| Requirements Quality | 10% | Testable, prioritized, traced |\n| Metrics Quality | 10% | North Star defined, measurable |\n| UX Coverage | 5% | User journeys documented |\n| Technical Feasibility | 5% | Constraints, dependencies |\n| Risk Management | 5% | Risks with mitigations |\n\n### Step 4: Gap Analysis\n\nFor each low-scoring category (< 7.0):\n\n1. What's specifically missing?\n2. What would improve the score?\n3. What's the effort to fix?\n4. Who should own the fix?\n\n### Step 5: Prioritized Recommendations\n\nRank improvements by:\n1. Score impact (higher weight categories first)\n2. Effort required (quick wins first)\n3. Blocker status (blockers must be fixed)\n\n## Output Template\n\n```markdown\n## PRD Quality Review: [Title]\n\n### Overall Score: X.X / 10.0\n**Decision**: [APPROVE | REVISE | HUMAN REVIEW | REJECT]\n\n### Category Breakdown\n\n| Category | Score | Status |\n|----------|-------|--------|\n| Problem Definition | X.X | ✓/⚠/✗ |\n| Solution Fit | X.X | ... |\n| ... | | |\n\n### Strengths\n- [What's done well]\n\n### Blockers (must fix)\n- [Critical issues]\n\n### Top 3 Recommendations\n\n1. **[Category]**: [Specific action]\n   - Impact: +X.X points\n   - Effort: [Low/Medium/High]\n\n2. **[Category]**: [Specific action]\n   - Impact: +X.X points\n   - Effort: [Low/Medium/High]\n\n3. **[Category]**: [Specific action]\n   - Impact: +X.X points\n   - Effort: [Low/Medium/High]\n\n### Next Steps\n1. [Immediate action]\n2. [Follow-up action]\n```\n\n## Decision Thresholds\n\n- **>= 8.0**: APPROVE - Ready for implementation\n- **>= 6.5**: REVISE - Minor issues, can proceed with fixes\n- **< 6.5**: HUMAN REVIEW - Significant gaps need attention\n- **<= 3.0**: REJECT - Critical blockers, not ready\n\n## Common Issues\n\n### Problem Definition\n- No evidence cited\n- Impact not quantified\n- Problem too vague\n\n### User Understanding\n- Generic personas\n- No validated pain points\n- Missing user research\n\n### Scope Discipline\n- No non-goals defined\n- Goals not measurable\n- Scope too broad\n\n### Requirements Quality\n- Missing acceptance criteria\n- No priority assigned\n- Not traceable to goals\n\n### Metrics Quality\n- No North Star metric\n- Metrics not measurable\n- Missing baselines/targets",
