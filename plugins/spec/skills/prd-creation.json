  "instructions": "# PRD Creation Skill\n\nYou are guiding the user through creating a comprehensive Product Requirements Document.\n\n## Philosophy\n\n- **Evidence over opinion**: Every claim needs supporting data\n- **Users first**: Start with who we're building for\n- **Scope discipline**: Non-goals are as important as goals\n- **Multiple options**: Never commit to the first solution\n\n## Creation Flow\n\n### Phase 1: Problem Discovery\n\nBefore any solution, deeply understand the problem:\n\n1. What evidence shows this is a real problem?\n2. How many users are affected?\n3. What's the cost of not solving it?\n4. Is this the root cause or a symptom?\n\nUse `prd_add_problem` with:\n- Clear problem statement\n- User impact description\n- Confidence level (0-1)\n\n### Phase 2: User Definition\n\nDefine 1-3 target personas:\n\n1. Who experiences this problem most acutely?\n2. What are their top 3 pain points?\n3. What workarounds do they use today?\n4. What would success look like for them?\n\nUse `prd_add_persona` with:\n- Descriptive name and archetype\n- Specific pain points (not generic)\n\n### Phase 3: Scope Setting\n\nEstablish clear boundaries:\n\n**Goals** (use `prd_add_goal`):\n- SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound\n- Link to success metrics\n\n**Non-Goals** (use `prd_add_nongoal`):\n- Explicitly state what you won't do\n- Prevents scope creep later\n- Equally important as goals\n\n### Phase 4: Solution Exploration\n\nExplore 2-3 options before committing:\n\nFor each option (use `prd_add_solution`):\n- Brief description\n- Pros and cons\n- Cost estimate (T-shirt: S/M/L/XL)\n- Technical complexity\n- Problems it addresses\n\nThen select one (use `prd_select_solution`):\n- Clear rationale for choice\n- Acknowledge tradeoffs accepted\n\n### Phase 5: Requirements\n\nDocument functional requirements:\n\nFor each (use `prd_add_requirement`):\n- Clear, testable statement\n- Priority: P0 (launch blocker), P1 (important), P2 (nice-to-have)\n- Acceptance criteria\n- Trace to goals/problems\n\n### Phase 6: Success Metrics\n\nDefine measurable outcomes:\n\n1. **North Star** (one primary metric)\n   - What single number indicates success?\n   - Use `prd_add_metric --type=northstar`\n\n2. **Supporting Metrics**\n   - 2-4 metrics that ladder to North Star\n   - Use `prd_add_metric --type=supporting`\n\n3. **Guardrail Metrics**\n   - What shouldn't regress?\n   - Use `prd_add_metric --type=guardrail`\n\n### Phase 7: Risk Management\n\nIdentify and mitigate risks:\n\nFor each (use `prd_add_risk`):\n- Impact: high/medium/low\n- Likelihood: high/medium/low\n- Mitigation strategy\n- Owner for mitigation\n\n## Quality Checks\n\nBefore finalizing:\n\n1. Run `prd_validate` - fix any structural issues\n2. Run `prd_score` - aim for >= 8.0\n3. Review category breakdowns\n4. Address any blockers\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n- Vague problems without evidence\n- Generic personas (not real users)\n- Missing non-goals\n- Jumping to solutions\n- Unmeasurable metrics\n- Risks without mitigations",
